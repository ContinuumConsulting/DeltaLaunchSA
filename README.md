# DeltaLaunch Strikes Again
# (aka "My OCD ordered me to make this program")
My first time doing a C++ application.
This will be painful. REALLY painful.
At the moment, it loads a config.ini, if it's a path it launches the program.

## To Do
* ~~Don't cry immediately: **MISHON COMPREE**~~
* Launch apps: **dun**
* Load config.ini: **dun**
* Print section of the config.ini except settings: **dun**
* Launch programs from config.ini: I cant believe that but **dun**
* Launch websites from config.ini: *to do*
* GUI: *to do*
* Set GUI icons: *to do*
* Set GUI columns: *to do*
