# DeltaLaunch Strikes Again
### (aka "My OCD ordered me to make this program")
My first time doing a C++ application.
I tried this before with C#, that's the reason of the "Strikes Again".  
This will be painful.  
REALLY painful.  

At the moment, it loads a config.ini, shows you the sections, and makes you choose what you wanna run; if the key is a path (literally, "path = C://yourstuff"), it launches the program, if it's a url ("url = example.com") it opens it in your default browser.

I'm using [SimpleIni](https://github.com/brofield/simpleini) to parse the config file.

## Why
Because I have a lot of programs pinned in the taskbar, and it hurts my OCD. I'll add urls just because I can.
